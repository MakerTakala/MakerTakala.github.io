# About Me

Hello, welcome everyone who clicked here! I am **Chung-Chun Wang**, or you can also call me **Takala**!

I am currently a senior year student at the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, about to graduate.  
My main research areas are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.  
In terms of development, I mainly focus on web front-end and back-end, with some personal projects on the side.

I love puzzles, music, and drama, and I also enjoy reading mystery novels.  
I am a lifelong cat lover and milk tea enthusiast.  
Also, I am a loyal fan of [SLSMusic](https://www.youtube.com/@SLSMusic) (If you like piano music, go listen! Highly recommended!).  
I am also a member of the badminton and volleyball teams (Who says all computer science students are couch potatoes!).

My life goal is to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible, so I can spend my days working on little programs I love and contributing to education by promoting computer science knowledge.  
Here, I will mainly share various thoughts and experiences, possibly including some technical discussions or my random musings. In the near future, I might start by updating my escape room recommendations list.  
If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](mailto:ccwangtakala@gmail.com). As an active internet user, I usually reply instantly, so no need to worry about not finding me.
