# About Me

Hello, everyone who clicked here. I am **Chung-Chun Wang**, or you can call me **Takala** as well!

I am currently a senior student majoring in Computer Science at National Taiwan Normal University and about to graduate. My main research areas are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. In terms of development, I primarily focus on both front-end and back-end web development, along with some personal projects on the side.

I love puzzles, music, and drama, and I enjoy reading mystery novels in my spare time. I am a lifelong cat lover and milk tea enthusiast. Additionally, I am a loyal fan of [SLSMusic](https://www.youtube.com/@SLSMusic) (anyone who loves piano music should definitely check it out!). I am also a member of my universityâ€™s badminton and volleyball teams (who said computer science majors are all couch potatoes?).

My life goal is to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible so that I can spend my days creating little programs I love and contributing to education by promoting information technology knowledge. Here, I will mainly share various insights and experiences, possibly including some technical discussions or my random thoughts. In the near future, I plan to update my escape room recommendations list. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](mailto:ccwangtakala@gmail.com). I am usually very responsive, so don't worry about not being able to reach me.
